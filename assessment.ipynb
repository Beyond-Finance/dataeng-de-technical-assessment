    "# Data Engineer - Technical Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section of the interview at Beyond Finance, you will be assessed on your ability to perform several Data Engineering tasks. To perform well on this task, you will demonstate competence in the following areas:\n",
    "\n",
    "* preprocessing data to prepare for a database load\n",
    "* understanding entity relationships in a database\n",
    "* merging data from different tables\n",
    "* filtering data to relevant subsets\n",
    "* calculating aggregations and descriptive statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "It will be pretty difficult to complete all questions in the allotted time. Your goal is not to speed through the answers, but to come up with answers that demonstrate your knowledge. It's more about your thought process and logic than getting the right answer or your code.\n"

    "In this section you will take files from the ./raw_data/ subfolders, combine them into a single newline-delimited `json.gz` file per subfolder, and place that CSV file in a ./processed_data/ directory. You may have to do some light investigation into the data files to understand their file formats and delimiters\n",

    "- Can you handle all subfolders in a single pass over the raw data files?\n",
    "- How can you limit memory consumption? (hint `chunksize`)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Wrangling\n",
    "For this section, we'll pretend you loaded the raw data plus additional tables into a small SQLite database containing roughly a dozen tables. **We've provided this database for you so don't worry about loading it yourself**. If you are not familiar with the SQLite database, it uses a fairly complete and standard SQL syntax, though does not many advanced analytics functions. Consider it just a remote datastore for storing and retrieving data from. \n",
